Name: Christopher Morikawa

Breif Introduction to the game:
The Custom_BallGame_ChrisMorikawa game is based off the roll
a ball game, but this time with Ramps and the world tilting back
and forth. The objective of the game is too collect all the
coins and bring up the win text!

Instructions on how to play:
You use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the ball.
up - move forward
down - move back
right - move right
left - move left

-You can select Play to play the game or exit to exit the game.
-When you play the game collect all the coins, there are 20 of them.
Once you collected all the coins a text will show "You Win!". To exit the
game just close the game window using the mouse.

My Contributions to the game:
- I tilted the world to make it challenging for the player, made a new script for it.
I added ramps to make the player climb and fly in the air. Also change the
coins to be actual coin like rather than the cube like from the tutorial.
Added a music and sound effect to the game. Also if you fall off the map you will
respawn back to the original spot, made another script for that for the player.


What I have learn from the assignment:
-I have learned about movement of objects to make them more cool and interesting.
Also I learned about scripts and C# language. Also how to add music and sound effects
to the game. A more important lesson is how to make menus and changing scenes, it was
challenging at first, because I thought they were simple, but there is more to it
than what I thought.
